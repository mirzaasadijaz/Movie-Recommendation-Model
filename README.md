# Movie-Recommendation-Model
The goal is to recommend movies to users based on a "Content" feature that combines genres and user-generated tags. By analyzing the textual relationships between movies, the system can suggest films similar to those a user already enjoys (e.g., searching for "Star Wars" returns other sci-fi space operas).
